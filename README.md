# Runes4Tools
The Runes4Tools Project supplies the "Runed Workflow" which functions the same one every Platform and every Programming Language

## Project Workspace Structure
The workspace structure orientates itself on the Maven Project Structure as such it uses Maven3.
> As Maven 3 does not fully support all the Prog-Languages included in Runes4Tools Maven3 is patched using `runes-lifecycle4maven` and `runes4maven`.
